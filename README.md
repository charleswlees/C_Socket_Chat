# CS5700 HW: C Socket Programming Chat Application

This homework involved using C socket programming to create a chat application over TCP. 

Use the included makefile to compile the project. 

Speakd.c is the server side, it must be run first as it will be listening for a connection. \
Speak.c is the client side and tries to reach out to establish the connection. \
Both programs communicate on port 36435.
